Welcome! I'm **Jing Shujun**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Neuroscience** at **Peking University School of Basic Medical Sciences**. My research centers around **brain-computer interfaces**, **multi-modal neural signal decoding**, and **intelligent diagnostic systems** for psychiatric disorders.

My expertise lies in experimental design and computational analysis in neuroscience and neural dynamics, with ongoing efforts to bridge fundamental neural mechanisms and real-world clinical data.

This site showcases my recent work, including:
- 🧠 Research projects and tools for neural signal processing  
- 🧪 Publications and presentations in neuroscience and biomedical engineering  
- 💡 My academic CV and portfolio

Feel free to browse the portfolio, download my CV, or reach out via the contact links.
